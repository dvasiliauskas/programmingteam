UCF's Programming Team training for ACM ICPC compeitions
--------------------------------------------------------

I've been part of competitive programming teams since 2010 and have been a member of UCF's women's programming team 
since its inaugural team in 2012. We hold weekly lectures and are constantly training for new competitions. 

This repo is a collection of all competitive trainings I have done since 2010.
